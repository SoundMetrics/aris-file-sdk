# ARIS File Utility Code

This folder contains code that can be used to examine ARIS files, which are recordings of images generated by an ARIS sonar.

## Contents

* **SoundMetrics.Aris.Headers** - compiles the `FileHeader.cs` and `FrameHeader.cs` files into assembly `SoundMetrics.Aris.Headers`, which is available as a **nuget** package. These files are not to be modified as they are generated by code in `..\sdk-build-tools\GenerateHeader\`.
* **SoundMetrics.Aris.Files** - contains code to detect corruption in `.aris` files as well as code to truncate corrupted files (the trailing portion of the file is what is often affected). This assembly is available as a **nuget** package.
* **SoundMetrics.Aris.Files.Tests** - unit tests for the above assemblies.

## Notes

The `FileHeader.cs` and `FrameHeader.cs` files are generated by a script with a namespace (`Aris.FilesTypes`) that is outside the namespace otherwise used in `SoundMetrics.Aris.Files`. This older namespace is retained for backwards compatibility.
